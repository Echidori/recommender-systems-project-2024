# recommender-systems-project-2024
In order to use the project, please use the `data_download.sh` shell script to download the required data. The first cell of the python notebook can also be used to do so. I am aware that there might be problems on the uploaded jupyter notebook because of an error with my Python interpreter in the last hour of my work. I, however, believe the model should be working without much problem.

The Notebook you will find, `FinalProject_Notebook`, contains all the work of this project.
